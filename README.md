## About

xr3 (x-ray 3) is a tool for x-ray scintillator detector/detector array modelling.
It was designed for educational purposes only.

## Physics

The program uses simple exponential attenuation formulae and tables of attenuation coefficients to determine x-ray absorption and detector efficiency values. No Monte-Carlo methods or obscure nuclear processes are taken into account.

## Requirements

- [python3](https://www.python.org) (tested on 3.5)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) (only if you need plots)

## Platform support

Because it uses tkinter for the GUI, it's likely to run on any Mac, Windows and Linux computer. Tested on OSX 10.10.

## How to use

- Run the main script:

	python3 xr3.py

- Set parameters you want. If you'd like to edit a particular detector/source, first adjust values, then select item in the list and press 'Rewrite'
- Press simulate

### Source options

- Isotope
- Mass or activity (you cannot set both for obvious reasons)
- Absolute position (1D)
- Casing/moderator type
- Casing/moderator thickness

### Scintillator options

- Scintillator
- Cross-section
- Absolute position (1D)
- Casing/moderator type
- Casing/moderator thickness
- Thickness of the scintillator

### Experiment options

- Exposition time
- Number of ADC channels
- Detector energy resolution (sadly you should set it by yourself)
- ADC CFD threshold
- ADC max energy/ max signal

### What you can get

- Console data about isotope x-ray lines (events, efficiency, absorption values, etc.). If you just want some basic info about detector efficiency, in config.ini set 'console_output_type' to PARTIAL
- Modelled spectra (if matplotlib/numpy installed)
- Save detectors/isotope compositions and share them with your friends (just joking, don't do that, I'm serious)

## Issues

- Possibly it won't work properly in very close source-detector relative positioning
- Linear interpolation of mass attenuation / photoabsorption coefficients
- Point isotropic sources only
- All detectors are simulated as cylinders oriented to a source
- Technically only 1D scene configuration
- Very simple Compton-effect simulation
- No pair production yet
- No simultaneous detection events and no temporal resolution
- No inner radioactivity
- Background simulation is stupid

## ToDo list

- User-friendly app settings
- Python2.7 support
- Experiment options saves
- Console (no-gui) interface
- More scintillator materials / media / moderators
- Better interaction physics
- Energy resolution calculations (mb)
- Basic PMT simulation (mb)
- More geometries (mb)
- Working tags
- Optimization

## App structure

- xr3.py — main module
- config.ini — program preferences
- /templates/ - list of saved source/detector configurations (scenes) including default scene
- /media/ - scene media data (air, water, etc.)
- /materials/ - moderators, cases
- /scintillators/
— /isotopes/
- /docs/ - additional documentation

## Adding data

Basically each data file is a table of values. You can add/modify anything on your own risk.
.isotope file consist of a header with isotope name, atomic mass, half-life and tags; and energy(kev)/probability(%) values (i.e. x-ray spectrum)
.mat file consists of name and density(g/cm3) values and a table of energy(MeV)/mass attenuation k/mass photoabsorption k data. Moderator files use only the first two columns of data.
